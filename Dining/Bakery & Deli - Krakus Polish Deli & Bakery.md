# Krakus Polish Deli & Bakery
https://www.krakusbakery.com/ is in Bensenville, IL 60106 I think this is the correct one
https://krakuspolishdeli.com/ Is in Yorktown, Ohio

## The bread
Kyle brought us most of a loaf, plus a bun of some kind.  The loaf was sourdough and moderately crusty.  Both items were nice.

## Recommender
[[Kyle Mikos]] from unit 2 at Monticello has been promising to bring us bread from this bakery for many months in return for all the food we share with him and the other board members.  After the meeting on 11 February 2025 I asked him for the name of the bakery so we could try it ourselves.

[[Kyle Mikos]] did eventually bring us some bread form this place.
