# Restaurant - King Crab House Chicago
Karen, Henry and I ordered delivery from this place on Thursday, 15 May 2025.  I had the crab stuffed mushrooms and the salmon and prawns.  Henry had a crab roll and popcorn shrimp and Karen had a boil bag with shrimp, sausage and vegetables.

I found it to be profoundly mediocre but entirely servicable.

# Recommendation
