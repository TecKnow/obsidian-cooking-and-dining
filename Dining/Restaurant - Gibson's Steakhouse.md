# Gibson's steakhouse
## Key lime pie
[[Kyle Mikos]] brought us a quarter of a key lime pie from this place after a condo board meeting.  The thought was good but the pie was terrible.  The curd is slightly gummy, the meringue is incredibly sweet, and none of us would have been able to tell you it was supposed to be lime if we had not ourselves been told.  The only flavors were sweetness and citrus acid.
