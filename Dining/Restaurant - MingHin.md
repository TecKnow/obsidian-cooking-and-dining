# Restaurant - MingHin
A Chinese and dim sum restaurant chain local to the Chicago area.  It seems a bit pricier than other dim sum options.

## Recommender
Edward Locke, from Adventurer's League at the Dice Dojo, didn't directly recommend this place.  Rather, he visited it with family and I found out about it through the related Facebook post on 25 May 2025.
