# Romanian Kosher Sausage Company
- website: [I want Romanian | Romanian kosher deli](https://iwantromanian.com/)

## Notable items
### Kosher beef fry
Sometimes called "kosher bacon" this is basically beef cured as if it were bacon.  It can be eaten raw, but nobody in the house particularly likes it that way.  It can be fried like bacon and it's very good.  It makes the house smell like my grandmother's kitchen.  I think that suggests she cooked with beef fat.
### Salami
The salami here is quite good.  They sell it at various harnesses but never seem to have the hardest options in stock.

Eventually, someone who works there told Henry that they just move the salamis to the next hardest category every few weeks, so he could age the sausage at home himself.  He occasionally parks salamis in the back of the fridge to do this.
#### Salami crystals
At one point Henry forgot about some salamis he had left in the back of the fridge to age.  They were left alone for several months.  We did eat them.  They were very tasty, but extremely hard.  They seemed to dissolve on the tongue.

When Henry tried to slice them, they managed to resist the vintage, all-metal slicer attachment for our KitchenAid mixer.  He had to set the slicer to the widest setting and the mixer to the lowest speed to slowly win out against the sausage.

It was a fun accidental experiment, but he probably shouldn't go quite this far again.

## Background
Apparently this place is well known particularly among the Chicago Jewish community but used to have a negative reputation.  It has improved dramatically in the past few years, but by that time most people had moved on to other options even if that was just a Whole Foods with a large kosher section.
