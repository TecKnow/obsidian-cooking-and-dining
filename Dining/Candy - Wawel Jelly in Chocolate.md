# Wawel Jelly in Chocolate
These polish candies are basically Turkish delight covered in chocolate.  I think it's hard to find good quality Turkish delight reliably so I really appreciate these.  The flavors are lemon, pineapple, orange, and raspberry.  All the flavors are distinct, and all but the raspberry are quite strong.  The orange flavor tastes very much like Jaffa cakes.

## Recommendation
[[PS1 - Eastern European Snacks Dan]] brought a bag of these to NERP at PS:1 in early March, and I liked them so much that I decided to order some.
