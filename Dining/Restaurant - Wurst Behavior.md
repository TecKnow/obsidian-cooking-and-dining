# Restaurant - Wurst Behavior

Josh, Henry and I ordered from this place on Grubhub for dinner on Saturday, 24 May 2025.  I had the Italian, the mushroom truffle brat, crispy Brussel sprouts and fries.  Everything was fine but it came with at least one unexpected ingredient.  The mustard on the truffle brat was very sweet, and I couldn't tell how spicy the Italian was because there were so many peppers on it.  
## Menu mismatch
The GrubHub and website menus don't match.  The only side available on GrubHub is fries, but the website lists other options like coleslaw.
