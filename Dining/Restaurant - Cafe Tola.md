# Cafe Tola
## website
[Cafe Tola](https://www.cafetola.com/)
## Description
Mexican plus coffee drinks.  They have empanadas, tacos, and burritos.  They provide counter service, similar to a Potbelly's.  They have seating, but only two regular height tables. The rest is stool height.

## Notes
Henry and I went here for dinner before NERP on Monday, 30 September 2024.  They have a case with pre-prepared empanadas and you carry your own orders to the table, like a Potbelly's.  We both had empanadas.  I also had a "spicy" iced mocha and some pre-packaged jalapeno and lime chips from a brand I was unfamiliar with.
