# Apna Indian Grill & Bar

The online order form doesn't have descriptions for any of the food, so it's necessary to check the menu section of the website separately.

The medium spice level here seems perfectly tolerable, and we will establish how reliable that is.

The food is good.  The spice profile is a little mellower and more rounded than when we make it at home.  The sauces seem to be a bit chunkier, like salsa, it's not unpleasant.

The first time we ordered from this place I had the goat rogan josh.  The second time I had the goat saag.

The main dishes and the chicken 65 are very good.  The chocolate cake dessert is dry and flavorless and relies on Hershey's chocolate syrup for flavor, it's not good.

## Recommendation
Josh found this place, it's near [[JT's Genuine Sandwich Shop]].
