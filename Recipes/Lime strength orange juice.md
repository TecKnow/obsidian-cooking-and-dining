# Lime strength orange juice
## Ingredients
### As written
-  2 cups orange juice
- 2 tsp citric acid
- 1.5 tsp malic acid
### Orange forward curd
- 6 fl. oz fresh squeezed orange juice
- 1 1/2 tsp citric acid
- 1 1/8 tsp malic acid
### Sour candy curd
- 6 fl. oz fresh squeezed orange juice
- 2 tsp citric acid
- 1.5 tsp malic acid
## Notes
The versions with fresh squeezed orange juice have more acid, proportionally, than the as-written version from the video.  This difference is intentional.  I assume that fresh orange juice has less acid than bottled juice.
