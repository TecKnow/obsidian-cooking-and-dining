## Directions
This is largely a dump-and-cook recipe
Cooking off the extra water is very time consuming, do not add more unless it's too thick to cook
1. Add the meat, tomato paste, and onions to the Instant Pot
2. Add the spices to the instant pot and mix well with the meat
3. Add liquid ingredients to the instant pot
4. Use a potato masher to mash the mixture as finely as possible
5. Cook at high pressure for 25 minutes.
6. This mixture should not foam so quick release is possible.
7. Fish out the bay leaf if possible
