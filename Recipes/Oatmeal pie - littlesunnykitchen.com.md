# Oatmeal pie
## Ingredients
- 1 9-inch pie crust
- 1 cup (192 g) light brown sugar
- 4 eggs at room temperature
- 3 tbsp (22.5 g) AP flour
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 cup (312 g) light corn syrup
- 2 tbsp (28 g) melted butter
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup quick oats, uncooked
## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C.
2. Roll out the pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish.  Pinch and crimp the edges.
3. In a large bowl, combine all of the filling ingredients, and whisk until well combined.
4. Pour the filling over the pie crust.
5. Bake in the oven for 50-60 minutes.  The filling should be only slightly jiggly in the center

7. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.
## Author notes
1. The pie needs time to set before serving, so make sure you let it cool down completely.
2. **Storing leftovers.**  Keep the pie covered and store it in the fridge for up to 3 days.  Serve cold or warm up slices in the microwave for just a few seconds to take off the chill.
