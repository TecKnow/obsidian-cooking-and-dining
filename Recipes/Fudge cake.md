# Fudge cake
## Ingredients
### The creamed
- 113 g (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 383 g brown sugar 
### The eggs
- 150 g (<span data-qty-parse>3 large</span>) eggs
- 7 g vanilla extract
### The dry goods
- 85 g (3 oz) unsweetened baking chocolate
- 305 g AP flour
- 12 g baking soda
- 2 tsp espresso powder (probationary)
- 6 g salt
### The liquid
- 227 g sour cream
- 227 g water, boiling
## Directions
1. Place an oven rack in position C and preheat the oven to 350F
2. Prep a 9x3-inch-deep round cake pan or a 9x13 inch rectangular pan and set aside.
3. Pulverize the chocolate in a food processor until there is nothing but chocolate dust and small chunks.  Add the remaining dry goods and pulse several times until the chocolate and flour are completely homogenized.  Set aside.
4. Beat together the eggs and the vanilla extract.  Set aside.	
5. Assemble all the ingredients, except the water, via the creaming method, alternating three doses of the Dry Goods with two doses of the sour cream.	
6. With the stand mixer on low, add the boiling water and continue mixing until a loose but uniform batter (with no lumps) is achieved.
7. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 1/2 hour at 350F, then reduce the oven to 300F and bake for another 1/2 hour.  The cake is done when the internal temperature has reached 175F or 180F.	
8. Remove the cake from the oven and let it sit in the pan for 15 minutes before turning it out onto a cooling rack.  Allow the cake to cool completely before frosting.
