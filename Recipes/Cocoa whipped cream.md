# Cocoa whipped cream
## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp (28 ml) water
- 3 g (1 tsp) unflavored powdered gelatin
- 465 g (2 cups) heavy cream
- 63g (1/2 cup) hot cocoa mix
- 1 tsp (5 ml) vanilla extract
## Directions
1. Put a stand mixer bowl and its whisk attachment (or, if youâ€™re using a hand mixer, a large stainless-steel bowl and a whisk) in the freezer to chill for about 10 minutes.
2. While the bowl and whisk are chilling, stir the water and the gelatin together in a metal measuring cup or a very small saucepan and set aside for 5 minutes. Then, dissolve the gelatin over low heat, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat.
3. Retrieve the mixing bowl from the chill and pour in the cream, cocoa mix, and vanilla. Mix on low speed until thoroughly mixed, about 2 minutes.
4. With the mixer running, drizzle in the dissolved gelatin solution, boost the speed to high, and whip until medium peaks develop, 1 to 2 minutes. Frost cake as desired.
## Notes
- We usually use Ghirardelli dark hot cocoa mix or something similar, rather than mixing up Alton Brown's hot cocoa mix using the instructions on the source page.
