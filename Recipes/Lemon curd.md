# Lemon curd
## Ingredients
- 1 (3.5 g) gelatin leaf
- 3 lemons, zest
- 3 lemons, (120 ml)  juice
- 250 g superfine sugar
- 165 g (1.5 sticks) unsalted butter
- 4 eggs
## Directions
1. If you are using the gelatin, leave it to soak in a little ice- cold water.
2. Put the fruit juice, zest, sugar and butter in a saucepan and place over a low heat until the butter is melted and the sugar has dissolved.
3. Meanwhile, whisk the eggs lightly in a separate bowl.
4. Pour the warm fruit mixture over the eggs, slowly, while constantly whisking. Return the mixture to the pan over a low-medium heat and cook for 10–15 minutes until thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. You want the temperature to reach 83°C/181°F.
5. If you’re using gelatin, squeeze out the excess water and mix it in to the curd once you’ve taken it off the heat.
6. Leave to cool in a bowl over an ice bath or in a shallow tray. Cover the surface directly with clingfilm (plastic wrap) and then keep in the fridge in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
