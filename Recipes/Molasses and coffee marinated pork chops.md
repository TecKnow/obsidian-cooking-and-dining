# Molasses and coffee marinated pork chops
## Ingredients
- 1 cup strong coffee, cooled
- 6 oz. molasses by weight
- 2 tbsp. apple cider vinegar
- 1 tbsp. Dijon mustard
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 6 to <span data-qty-parse>8</span> sprigs fresh thyme
- 1/2 tsp black pepper, freshly ground
- 4 1-inch-thick bone-in pork chops
## Directions
1. Combine all the ingredients in a 1-gallon zip-top bag, seal, and shake to combine.  Put in the refrigerator to marinate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight.
2. Heat a charcoal grill to medium-high.
3. Remove the pork chops from the marinade.  Transfer the marinade to a small saucepan and place it over high heat.  Bring to a boil, lower the heat to medium-high, and boil gently, stirring often, until reduced to about 1/2 cup, 12 to 15 minutes.  Remove and discard the thyme sprigs after the glaze has reduced. 
4. Meanwhile, grill the pork chops for 3 to 4 minutes per side, until they reach an internal temperature of 145â„‰.  Rest the pork chops for 4 to 5 minutes before serving with the glaze!
