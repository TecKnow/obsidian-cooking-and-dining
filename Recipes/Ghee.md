# Ghee
## Ingredients
- 1 pound unsalted butter
## Directions
1. Place the butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.  Bring the butter to a boil.  This takes approximately 2 to 3 minutes.
2. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium.  The butter will form a foam which will disappear.
3. Ghee is done when a second foam forms on top of the butter, and the butter turns golden.  This will take approximately 7 to 8 minutes.
4. Cook until the butter reaches 260â„‰
5. Brown milk solids will be in the bottom of the pan.  Gently pour into a heatproof container through a fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth.
6. Store in an airtight container being sure to keep free from moisture.
7. Ghee does not need refrigeration and will keep in airtight container for up to 1 month.
