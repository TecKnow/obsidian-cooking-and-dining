# Cocoa brownies
## Ingredients
- 4 large eggs
- 198 g granulated sugar
- 170 g light brown sugar
- 163 g natural cocoa powder
- 71 g AP flour
- 6 g kosher salt
- 227 g (2 sticks) unsalted butter
- 8 g vanilla extract
## Directions
1. Set oven to 300F
2. Lube an 8 inch square baking pan with non-stick spray. Trim a piece of parchment paper so that it fits just inside the baking dish with overhang on two sides and place it inside the pan.
3. Beat eggs with a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment at medium speed until fluffy and light yellow, 2 to 3 minutes
4. in a separate bowl, combine the granulated sugar, brown sugar, cocoa, flour, and salt. Drop the mixer speed to low and slowly introduce the sugar mixture. Follow with the butter and vanilla. Continue mixing until you've got a nice, smooth goo.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake for 45 to 50 minutes
6. Check for doneness by inserting the tip of an instant read thermometer intot he middle of the brownie, being careful not to touch the bottom of the pan; 195F is the target. Cool in the pan for 3 minutes, then lift the brownie out using the parchment paper as a sling
7. Cut the brownies into 9 pieces using a pizza wheel and move to a rack to cool completely.
