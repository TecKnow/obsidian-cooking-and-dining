# Gingersnap pie crust
## Ingredients
- 170 g gingersnap cookies
- 1 tbsp dark brown sugar
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 28 g (2 tbsp) unsalted butter, melted
## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 F.
2. Combine the gingersnaps, brown sugar, and ginger in a food processor.  Process until the cookies are fine crumbs.  Drizzle the butter into the crumb mixture.  Pulse 8 to 10 times to combine.
3. Press the gingersnap mixture into the bottom, up the sides, and just over the lip of a 9-inch glass pie dish.  Place on a half-sheet pan and bake until lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.  Cool the crust at least 10 minutes before filling.
