# Garlic chicken
## Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard 
- 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar 
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic 
- 2 teaspoons herbs de Provence 
- ½ teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon MSG
- 1 teaspoon black pepper 
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
- 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs 
- 2 tablespoons salted butter 
- 8 garlic cloves, chopped 
- ¼ cup water 
- ¼ cup heavy cream
## Directions
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the mustard, vinegar, minced garlic, herbes de Provence, salt, and pepper. Slowly whisk in the olive oil to emulsify and slightly thicken the mixture. Add the chicken and turn to coat. Allow the chicken to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes, or cover and refrigerate.  
2. Select SAUTÉ on the Instant Pot. When the pot is hot, add the butter. When the butter has melted, add the chicken, leaving as much marinade in the bowl as possible; set the marinade aside. Cook the chicken, turning once, until lightly browned on both sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
3. Add the chopped garlic to the pot. Cook, stirring continuously, until the garlic is fragrant and slightly softened, about 1 minute (take care not to let it burn). Add the water and reserved marinade and whisk to combine. Return the chicken to the pot. Select CANCEL.
4. Secure the lid on the pot. Close the pressure-release valve. Select MANUAL and set the pot at HIGH pressure for 5 minutes. At the end of the cooking time, allow the pot to sit undisturbed for 10 minutes, then release any remaining pressure. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Cover lightly with aluminum foil to keep warm.
5. Select SAUTÉ on the Instant Pot. While stirring continuously, slowly add the cream in a steady stream. Cook, stirring, until the sauce starts to thicken, 5 to 8 minutes. Select CANCEL.
6. Pour the sauce over the chicken and serve immediately.
### Recipe Note
If you don’t have herbs de Provence, you can substitute an Italian or Greek herb blend for a slightly different taste.
