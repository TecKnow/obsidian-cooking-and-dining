# Shredded chicken tacos (Tinga de pollo)
In addition to the Mexican-Style pickled vegetables (Escabeche) and the toppings included here, Mexican crema (or sour cream) and minced onion are also good choices.  If you can't find Cotija cheese, you can substitute crumbled feta.  The shredded chicken mixture also makes a good topping for tostadas.
## Ingredients
- 2 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thigs, trimmed
- salt and pepper
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 onion, julienned
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 <span data-qty-no-parse>14.5 fl. oz. can</span> fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 1/2 cups chicken broth
- 2 tbsp minced canned chipotle chili in adobo sauce
- 2 tsp adobo sauce
- 1/2 tsp brown sugar
- 1 tsp grated lime zest
- 2 tbsp lime juice, fresh
## Directions
### For the chicken
1. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.  Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering.  Add half of the chicken and brown on both sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side.  Transfer to a large plate.  Repeat with the remaining chicken.
2. Reduce heat to medium, add remaining 1 tablespoon of oil to now-empty pot, and heat until shimmering.  Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until browned, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic, cumin, and cinnamon and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.  Add tomatoes, broth, chipotle and adobo sauce, and sugar and bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits.
3. Return chicken to pot, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until meat registers 195 degrees, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping chicken after 5 minutes.  Transfer chicken to cutting board.
4. Transfer cooking liquid to blender and process until smooth, 15 to 30 seconds.  Return sauce to pot.  When cool enough to handle, use two forks to shred chicken into bite-size pieces.  Return chicken to pot with sauce.  Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until sauce is thickened and clings to chicken, about 10 minutes.  Stir in lime zest and juice.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
### For the tacos
1. Spoon chicken into center of each warm tortilla and serve, passing avocado, Cotija, scallions, cilantro, and lime wedges separately.
