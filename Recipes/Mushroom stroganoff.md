# Mushroom stroganoff - Recipe
## Ingredients
- 4 oz goat cheese
- 10 oz extra wide egg noodles
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter
- 5 portobello mushrooms, stems and gills removed, thinly sliced
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 10 scallions thinly sliced on the bias, white bottoms and green tops separated
- 1 tbsp AP flour
- 14 fl. oz beef broth
- 240 g (1 cup) sour cream
- 1/2 tsp black pepper, freshly ground
## Directions
1. Add the noodles to 4 quarts cold water in a large pot, cover, and place over high heat. Cook to al dente, 18 to 22 minutes, stirring occasionally (Cold Water Pasta, see M)
2. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a 10-inch straight-sided sauté pan over medium-high heat.
3. Increase the heat to high, add half of the mushrooms and sprinkle with ½ teaspoon of the salt. Sauté for 5 to 6 minutes, until the mushrooms darken and reduce in volume by half. Remove to a bowl.***	
4. Repeat with the remaining 1 tablespoon butter, the remaining mushrooms and the remaining ½ teaspoon salt, along with the white bottoms of the scallions.		
5. Return the first batch of mushrooms to the pan, sprinkle in the flour and stir to combine, cooking for 1 minute, or until the flour disappears and a dark “fond” appears on the bottom of the pan.
6. Deglaze the pan with the beef broth and as soon as it simmers (almost immediately), decrease the heat to low and cook for 10 to 12 minutes to reduce the liquid.	
7. Add the sour cream, goat cheese and pepper and stir to combine. Bring to a bare simmer and cook, covered, for 2 to 4 minutes.
8. Drain the noodles and stir gently into the mushroom mixture. Turn onto a platter and garnish with the scallion tops and additional pepper.
