# Mint Italian meringue pavlova
## Ingredients
- 180 g egg whites, approx. <span data-qty-parse>6 eggs<span>
- 5 g light corn syrup
- 1 pinch cream of tartar
- 2 tsp white vinegar
- 360 g caster (superfine) sugar
- 80 ml water
- 10 ml vanilla extract
- 30 g cornstarch
- 141 g Ghirardelli mini chocolate chips
- 2 ml peppermint extract

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 250F
2. Clean all bowls with a small amount of vinegar
3. Use glass or metal bowls - not plastic - to separate the eggs
4. Whisk at medium speed for 7-10 minutes, past the frothy stage, until you see soft peaks form.  (You can also make this in a mixing bowl with a hand-held electric whisk, but it is easier in a stand mixer.)
5. Place the corn syrup and sugar in a heavy-bottomed pot
6. Cover the sugar with water, at least 2 fl. ounces but probably more
7. place the lid on the pot and bring it to a boil for about two minutes
8.Remove the lid and heat over a medium heat, without stirring, and when the sugar syrup reaches 116°C/241°F, put your stand mixer on high speed and whisk your egg whites to soft peaks.						
9. Once your sugar temperature has reached 119°C/246°F and your egg whites are at soft peaks, wipe the inside of the pot with a pastry brush to remove any crystals, lower the speed of the mixer to medium and, with the machine still on, carefully pour your sugar syrup down the side of the bowl into the egg whites.
10. Whisk the meringue at a high speed for 10–15 minutes until it is cooled, thick and glossy with stiff peaks.
11. Throw in your vanilla, cornstarch, peppermint, and mini chips and mix in slowly at first, gradually increasing the speed until it's all mixed in and then stop.  You want to keep it thick without deflating it.
12. Shape into one large mound or individual mounds on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment.
13. Bake a large pavlova for 3-4 hours (or individual ones for around an hour or so).  You will know it's done when you can lift it up lean gently from the paper.  Remove from the oven and leave to cool.  An untopped pavlova will keep, covered, at room temperature for up to 3 days.  Once topped, it's best eaten on the same day.
