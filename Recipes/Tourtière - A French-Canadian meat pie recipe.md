# Tourtière: A French-Canadian Meat Pie Recipe
## Ingredients
### Pie pastry
- 2 cups unbleached AP flour
- 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 2/3 cup butter or lard, chilled
- 6-7 tablespoons ice cold water
### Meat filling
- 2 large Russet or Yukon Gold potatoes about 1 pound
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1 small onion finely chopped
- 1 clove garlic finely minced
- 1 pound ground pork
- 1 pound ground beef
- 1/2 teaspoon Bells Poultry seasoning or your favorite poultry seasoning
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1/8 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 large egg scrambled for glazing
## Directions
### Prepare the pastry
1. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl.
2. Cut in butter or lard until mixture is a rough crumbly texture.
3. Add ice water one tablespoon at a time and mix just until the dough comes together.
4. Shape the dough into a ball, flatten, wrap, and chill in the refrigerator. While pastry is chilling, prepare the filling.
### Make the filling
1. Peel and cut potatoes into 2-inch chunks, add them to a medium saucepan, and fill with water until it covers the potatoes by 2-inches.
2. Bring the saucepan to a boil over high heat and then reduce the heat to medium-high and boil until the potatoes are until tender, about 12 minutes.
3. Reserve 1/2-cup of potato water and drain the rest. Mash potatoes and set aside.

4. Heat a large skillet over medium heat.
5. Add olive oil, onions, and garlic, and sauté until softened, about 3 minutes.
6. Add the ground beef and pork and cook until the meat is no longer pink. Drain off excess fat.
7. Add the poultry seasoning, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, salt, pepper, and reserved potato water. Mix well and simmer for about 10 minutes until the liquid is absorbed.
8. Remove the skillet from the heat, stir in mashed potatoes, and set the filling aside to cool slightly.
### Assemble the pie
1. Preheat oven to 400°F/205°C
2. On a lightly floured surface, divide dough in half and flatten one ball of dough with your hands. Roll dough to about 12-inches in diameter to fit a 9-inch pie pan.
3. Place the pastry into the pie plate and add the meat filling. Brush around the outer edge of the pastry with the beaten egg.
4. Roll out the top pastry and place on top of the filling. Fold the top crust under the bottom crust and pinch or flute the edges. Brush with egg wash and cut vent holes.
### Bake the meat pie
1. Bake the pie in a preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.
2. Remove the tourtière from oven and let it cool at least 10 minutes before serving.
## Make ahead tips
Yes, meat pies can be made ahead and frozen. In fact, it is common for families to gather and make up multiple meat pies at once and then freeze extra for later. After a visit to my family on Thanksgiving, it is not uncommon to bring home a frozen tourtière along with leftovers.

You can also make the meat filling and freeze it to fill pies later.
