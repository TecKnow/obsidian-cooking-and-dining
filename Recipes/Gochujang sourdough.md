- 100 grams garlic cloves

## Instructions
### Mix dough
1.  To a mixing bowl add water, gochujang, and salt.
2. Mix until it's completely dissolved.
3. Then mix up bread flour and spelt flour. 
4. Add the flour mixture to the gochujang mixture
5. Then add the sourdough starter.
6. Then mix it up with your hands until the flour has been hydrated.
7. Let it rest for an hour
### Prepare inclusions
1.  While the dough is resting, peel the garlic cloves.
2. While the dough is resting, chop the green onions finely.
### Bulk fermentation
1.  When it is time for the first set of stretch and folds we'll also mix in the inclusions
2.   Add about a quarter of the total garlic cloves and green onions on top.
3. Do a stretch and fold.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 a total of 4 times until all the inclusions have been added.
5. Put the dough in a bulking container and mark where the top of the dough is with a whiteboard marker.
6. Then put the dough in a warm place and let it grow by 25%.
### Divide and pre-shape
1. When the dough has grown, it is time to pre-shape it.  use your bench scraper to shape each dough into a loose ball.
2. When the doughs have been shaped, let them rest on the kitchen counter for 20 minutes.
### Final shape
1. After the 20 minutes are up, final shape them into batards.
2. Flour the top of the dough. Flip it over.
3. Move any cloves on the edges of the dough to the middle. Tease the dough out into a square.
4. Then fold the bottom up halfway. Fold the right side into the middle.
5. Fold the left side over. Then fold the top to the middle and tug the edges on the sides.
6. Then stitch at the top, the middle, and the bottom.
7. Grab a banneton and spritz it lightly with water. Flour it with rice flour.
8. Then shape the other dough the same way.

### Retard the dough
1. Put them both in bags and let them rest in the fridge for at least 8 hours and up to 48 hours.
### Bake
1. When ready to bake, heat your oven to 260°C/500°F with a baking steel and a Dutch oven inside.
2. When the oven has been heating for an hour, grab the first dough from the fridge.
3. Dust the dough with rice flour to help it slide off the peel when put in the oven.
4. Flip the dough onto the peel and then score the dough using a lame equipped with a razor blade.
5. Then add the bread to the Dutch oven, and put the lid on top.
6. Bake for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove the lid and reveal the bread.
7. Bake until the bread is done. In my oven, 25 minutes is appropriate; it might be less or more in your oven. Go for dark on the edges and super crispy.
8. Bake the other bread the same way.
