# Double chocolate cookies

## Ingredients
### Creamed
- 1136 g dark brown sugar
- 192 g granulated sugar
- 908 g or 2 lbs. unsalted butter, melted and cooled to below 80℉
### Dry
- 1080 g King Arthur bread flour
- 368 g Droste Dutch process cocoa powder
- 20 g Morton coarse kosher salt
- 10 g Ajinomoto MSG
- 8 g Arm & Hammer baking soda
- 2 tbsp espresso powder
### Eggs
- 4 whole eggs
- 4 egg yolks
- 2 tbsp vanilla extract
#### Egg substitution
- 6 tbsp flax
- 18 tbsp water
### Wet
- 12 tbsp whole milk
### Mix-ins
- 8 cups Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips
## Instructions
1. Melt the butter and set it aside to cool below 80℉
2. Measure the chocolate chips
4. Measure the white and brown sugars into the bowl of your mixer
5. Measure the dry ingredients into a large bowl and whisk them together
6. Separate 4 egg yolks
7. Lightly whisk the whole eggs and yolks together in another 3rd bowl
8. Whisk the vanilla extract into the eggs
9. Once the butter has cooled turn your mixer on low to break up any clumps in the sugars
10. With the mixer still on low, slowly pour the melted butter into the sugars
    - The mixture will start out very dark and wet, with a tendency to splatter
    - The mixture will become lighter, fluffier, and less likely to splatter as it is creamed
11. Gradually increase the speed to medium-high and cream for 5 minutes
12. Add the egg and vanilla mixture
13. Add half the dry ingredients, with the mixer on low add small amounts
    - If the mixer is throwing powder out of the bowl, use smaller increments and/or wait longer between doses.
14. Add about half the milk
15. stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl.
16.  Repeat steps 13 to 15
17. Add the chocolate chips
### To freeze dough
1. Cover a half sheet pan with parchment paper
2. Use a number 20 disher to scoop the dough into balls
3. Pack the dough balls as tightly as possible into a single layer on the sheet pan
4. Put the sheet pan in the freezer until the dough balls begin to freeze
5. Put the dough balls into freezer bags, don't forget to label and date
### To bake
1. Preheat oven to 375℉
2. Cover one or more half sheet pans with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.
3.  Place up to six dough balls on each half sheet pan
4. Bake for 14 minutes, flipping the pans top-to-bottom and front-to-back halfway through.
5. Remove from the oven and slide the parchment or baking mat onto a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes.
### What i mean when I say "add"
Unless otherwise noted, when I say to add an ingredient I mean to reduce the mixer speed to low and add it slowly, then briefly increase the mixer speed until it is incorporated.

When I say "Add half in small doses" or something similar, I mean for the mixer to stay on low until half has been added, then boosted to incorporate.  I do not mean to boost the mixer speed after each spoonful.
### Notes for melting and cooling butter
This is the most time consuming step.  You can choose to melt the butter in the microwave or on the stovetop.  Letting the butter get hotter than needed will only make cooling take longer, but preventing this requires watching it closely.  I often let it come to a boil briefly simply due to not watching it closely enough.

I suggest moving the butter to a metal bowl.  Stir the butter and check the temperature every ten to fifteen minutes.

If you are in a hurry you can put the butter in the freezer, stirring and checking its temperature every five minutes.  It's easy to overshoot with this method and the results tend not to be quite as good, so I almost never use it.
### Notes on separating eggs
I'm particularly fastidious about this.  Some people have good luck breaking all the eggs into a large bowl and fishing out the yolks with their hands.  But when making other recipes like meringues a single broken yolk can spoil the whole bowl so I don't use this method.

What I do instead is use two small glass bowls.  I crack the egg against another egg or the countertop, and then pour it into one of the glass bowls.  I pour from that bowl through my fingers and into the other small bowl.  This allows me to catch the egg yolk in my hand.  If needed, I pass the yolk from hand to hand over the bowl to separate any clinging whites.

The whites can be saved, even frozen, and used for other things.

## Equipment
- I strongly advise using a stand mixer for this recipe if you can.
- I use a 5 quart mixing bowl and the recipe as written is the largest batch that will fit.
- You will probably also want to use a bowl guard while you're adding the mix-ins at the very least.
### What if you don't have a stand mixer?
If you need to use a hand mixer for this, the creaming time will increase probably by a factor of 3 to about 15 minutes.  But you'll have to watch for color, texture, and volume to be sure.  I don't advise doing this recipe by hand, but in either case please consider working in smaller batches.
