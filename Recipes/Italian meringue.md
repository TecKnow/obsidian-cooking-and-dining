# Italian meringue
## Ingredients
- 90 g (3 1/4 oz) egg whites (<span data-qty-parse>3</span> egg whites)
- 180 g (6 1/3 oz) superfine sugar
- 40 ml (2 1/2 tbsp) water
## Directions
1. Place the egg whites in the clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.
2. Place your sugar in a heavy-bottomed pan and add the water.  heat over a medium heat, without stirring, and when the sugar syrup reaches 116 C /241 F, put your stand mixer on high speed and whisk your egg whites to soft peaks.
3. Once your sugar temperature has reached 119 C / 246 F and your egg whites are at soft peaks, lower the speak of your mixer to medium and, with the machine still on, carefully pour your sugar syrup down the side of the bowl into the egg whites.
4. Whisk the meringue at high speed for 10-15 minutes until it is cooled, thick and glossy with stiff peaks.  It is now ready to use and is best used immediately.  If you really need to, you can keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for 1 day / overnight, and then beat it again before using.
