# Mint chocolate chip meringues
## Ingredients
- 180 g egg whites, approx. 6 eggs
- 360 g caster (superfine) sugar
- 80 ml water
- 10 ml vanilla extract
- 30 g cornstarch
- whipped cream and seasonal fruit of your choice, to serve

## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 250F.
2. Place your egg whites in the clean bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment.
3. Whisk at medium speed for 7-10 minutes, past the frothy stage, until you see soft peaks form.  (You can also make this in a mixing bowl with a hand-held electric whisk, but it is easier in a stand mixer.)
4. Place your sugar in a heavy-bottomed pan and add the water. Heat over a medium heat, without stirring, and when the sugar syrup reaches 116°C/241°F, put your stand mixer on high speed and whisk your egg whites to soft peaks.						
5. Once your sugar temperature has reached 119°C/246°F and your egg whites are at soft peaks, lower the speed of the mixer to medium and, with the machine still on, carefully pour your sugar syrup down the side of the bowl into the egg whites.
6. Whisk the meringue at a high speed for 10–15 minutes until it is cooled, thick and glossy with stiff peaks. It is now ready to use and is best used immediately. If you really need to, you can keep it in an airtight container in the fridge for 1 day/overnight, and then beat it again before using.
7. Throw in your vanilla and cornflour and mix in slowly at first, gradually increasing the speed until it's all mixed in and then stop.  You want to keep it thick without deflating it.
8. Shape into one large mound or individual mounds on a baking sheet lined with baking parchment.
9. Bake a large pavlova for 3-4 hours (or individual ones for around an hour or so).  You will know it's done when you can lift it up lean gently from the paper.  Remove from the oven and leave to cool.  An untopped pavlova will keep, covered, at room temperature for up to 3 days.  Once topped, it's best eaten on the same day.
