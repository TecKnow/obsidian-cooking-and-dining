Henry made [[Chicken biryani - Recipe]] for dinner tonight.  It was his first time making it. the flavor was good.  I don't think he let it cool at all before serving it, though.

Joseph Shaul, the public relations officer at Pumping Station One gave me a sugar-free Rockstar energy drink.  The taste reminded me of a candy that I couldn't name, and it was surprisingly good.  I didn't even initially realize it was sugar-free.
