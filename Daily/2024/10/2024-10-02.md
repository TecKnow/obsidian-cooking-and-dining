## Notes

I had the last of the [[Chicken biryani - Recipe]] leftovers before game night.

Josh Abrams has a baked potato bar for game night with chicken and pork chili toppings, among others.  Henry and I both thought the potatoes were at least a bit under done.  They also didn't seem to be baking potatoes.  This bothered Henry more than it bothered me. 

I had Henry stop at McDonald's on the way home.
