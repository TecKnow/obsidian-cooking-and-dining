## Dinner
I made [[Punjabi chicken curry - Recipe]] tonight.  Henry chopped the spinach in the food processor for me.

The sauce burned to the bottom of the InstantPot liner almost immediately, and continued to throw burn warnings while Josh tried to help.  Josh ended up adding 2.5 cups of additional water before it finally came up to pressure.  By this point dinner was already about an hour late so there wasn't time to reduce it very much despite the added liquid.

The chicken didn't really need to be shredded in the mixer, as Josh said it came apart almost entirely just from using the tongs to extract it for this purpose.

Josh made rice using the stovetop pressure cooker and it seemed to go well despite the problems he has had with it in the past.
