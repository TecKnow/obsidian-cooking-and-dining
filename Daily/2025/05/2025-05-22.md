## Dinner
I made [[Beef rendang - Recipe]] for dinner tonight.  Seafood City doesn't have Beef Rendang curry paste anymore, and Josh and Henry couldn't find it anywhere else so Josh decided to make his own.  He used a [[foodwishes.com]] recipe.  It calls for much, much more curry paste.  

I tried to brown the paste in the 15 inch skillet, it took about 15 minutes to do.  And once I added the meat it was too much material for even the large skillet to manage.  Also I don't think the meat was actually browning in with that much paste.

I updated the recipe to say 1-inch chunks, since an early log entry says we prefer that the meat break apart more easily.
