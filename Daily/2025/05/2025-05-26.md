Today I made an [[Ice box cake]].  The recipe calls for 6 cups of cream to make whipping cream but I only had four cups.  There was still a small amount of cream left over even after packing the cream and cookies into the loaf pan.  So four cups of cream should be sufficient.

For those four (4) cups of whipping cream I used 100 grams of sugar and 160 grams of malted milk powder.  The cake turned out softer than expected.  40 grams of malted milk powder per cup of cream is not enough to produce the results we like the most.

We tried using store bought cookies.  They were the only crispy double-chocolate cookies at the store Henry stopped at.  The cookies melded with the whipped cream successfully but the full-sized chocolate chips were a bit much.  Mini chocolate chips would work better, but would probably require us to go back to making the cookies from scratch.
