Today I made [[Recipes/Garlic chicken|Garlic chicken]] for dinner.  Yesterday when I made the marinade I accidentally misread teaspoons of herbs de provonce as tablespoons.  So I added about three times the listed amount of the ingredient.  I was worried that the meal would be borderline inedible but it was basically fine.  It definitely wasn't an improvement though, so I won't be doing this again on purpose.
