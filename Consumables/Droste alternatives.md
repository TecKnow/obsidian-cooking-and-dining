# Droste alternatives

## 28 September 2025
Droste Dutch processed cocoa powder hasn't been available from Amazon or an ylocal stores for a few months.  I looked online today and it seems that Droste has gone out of business after 160 years.  The internet suggested a few alternatives

- King Arthur Flour triple cocoa blend
- Guittard
- Cocoa barry extra brute
    - Apparently cocoa barry is a terrible company for reasons I'll need to investigate
