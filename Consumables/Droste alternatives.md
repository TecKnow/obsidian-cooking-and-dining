# Droste alternatives

The Dutch cocoa company Droste is shutting down.  Their Dutch-processed cocoa hasn't been available for months and won't be available again.  This is the cocoa that I use for things like the [[Double chocolate cookies]] so I need an alternative.

## King Arthur Flour
It looks like King Arthur Flour (KA) produces a range of cocoa powders.  Most of them are a mix of natural, Dutch-processed, and a black cocoa that is mostly for color. 

### Triple cocoa blend
This is their general-purpose cocoa powder that they claim is useable in almost any recipe

### Double dark cocoa blend
A mix of Dutch-processed and black cocoa

### Bensdorp cocoa powder
This is their straight Dutch-processed cocoa.

### Black cocoa
This cocoa is double Dutch-processed, and KA suggests it should be used sparingly and in combination with a regular Dutch-processed cocoa.

## Log
### 28 September 2025
Droste Dutch processed cocoa powder hasn't been available from Amazon or an ylocal stores for a few months.  I looked online today and it seems that Droste has gone out of business after 160 years.  The internet suggested a few alternatives:

- King Arthur Flour triple cocoa blend
- Guittard
- Cocoa barry extra brute
    - Apparently cocoa barry is a terrible company for reasons I'll need to investigate
