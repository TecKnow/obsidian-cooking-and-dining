# Real Chili copycat
## Wednesday, 8 April 2020
### Questions for after eating it
I found Instant Pot cooking times ranging from 14 to 25 minutes.  I chose the higher end because we know that Real Chili is simmered for a very long time.  

Do I feel like the combination of cayenne, paprika, chili powder, and peppers is too much?
I only chose peppers in adobo sauce because the Marquette University recipe didn’t say what kind of chili peppers to use.  I was guessing based on what I thought college students were like to have, and they won because they come in a can.  Would I like to try something else?
I took out the fresh garlic because I don’t think there’s anything that chunky in Real Chili, do I want to put it back?
How do I feel about the use of white sugar?
How do I feel about the use of Worcestershire sauce?
How do I feel about the use of cocoa powder?
Would I like to replace the chopped yellow onion with onion powder so there are even fewer solid ingredients?
Josh likes allspice, so consider trying to leave that in.
Consider making the recipe according to the original, Food Wishes instructions

Josh suggested leaving out the sugar.
Henry wants a layer of scum, which I assume is the result of the beef suet.
The texture is good but it’s too wet.  It needs to be reduced significantly.
It isn’t spicy enough by far.  The cayenne pepper should be doubled or even tripled.
### Text from Harley
Harley worked at Real Chili for many years and sent me the following message about the food there:

Hey David, unfortunately, the recipe is also kept secret from the people that work there as well. The only things I have been able to find out from working there are that we do not use any cinnamon, but we do use dark chocolate, cayenne, and beef suet. That's, unfortunately, all I know

I’m going to use up the last of the suet in this attempt.
I should write down how much suet there is.  
92 grams
I’m going to triple the cayenne pepper.  (recipe updated)
I’m going to leave out the sugar. (recipe updated)
I’m going to include the allspice because it’s one of Josh’s favorites (recipe updated)
I’m going to include the minced garlic because we’re running low on garlic powder. (recipe updated)

I didn’t have any suet this time.  This was also the first time that I used supermarket ground beef.  There is more fat in the supermarket ground beef than in the meat that we normally have.  There’s no room for suet or other additional fat when it is used.  It produces a thick scum on top of the stew by itself.
Twelve cups of water are far too much water for a double batch.  The stew simmered for hours and reduced by at least 4 cups.  I think the over-boiling made the stew even mushier than usual.
### Suggestions for next time
Don’t add fat if store bought ground beef is to be used.
Cut the water amount, maybe try 8 cups for a double batch next time.

Josh thinks it could be even spicier, consider increasing the paprika this time, since the cayenne has already been significantly increased.
I (David) didn’t mash the meat fine enough and it accidentally had some texture.
I reduced the water for a double batch from 8 cups to 6 and it worked well.
I used 100 grams of beef suet and it seemed fine.

I cut the salt back to the normal amount I would use for this amount of meat

I (David) am going to make this for board game night.  Levi can't have onions, bell peppers, or paprika.  Josh thinks I should further increase the cayenne pepper to compensate.  I’ve already dramatically increased the cayenne though, and the internet suggests that increasing the pepper (black and/or white) might also help.
