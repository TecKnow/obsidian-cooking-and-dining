# Oatmeal pie - littlesunnykitchen.com
## Friday, 14 March 2025
I made this for Pumping Station: One's Pi Day celebration.  It was surprisingly popular and people did seem to immediately determine that it was an alternative to pecan pie. It's not as sticky or sweet, which I and multiple others did enjoy.

I used the same [[Gingersnap pie crust]] that I used for the [[Orange meringue pie]] and the filling leaked through and caramelized.  Nobody from PS1 complained but this was noticeable.  This recipe needs an actual pie crust.

### Suggestions for next time
1. This pie will not work with a crumb crust.
    1. Investigate alternative pie crust recipes
2. Consider other similar recipes and find the one you like the most.
