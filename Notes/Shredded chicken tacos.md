# Shredded chicken tacos

## Thursday, 22 July 2021

I (David) had Alex Sanchez and his roommate William over before they moved.  They both thought this recipe came out very well.

There’s no way to do large batches of this recipe without getting at least 2 large bowls, the mixer bowl, and the Dutch oven dirty.  

In light of the fact that the Dutch oven is over two burners, keeping the burners lower when simmering the chicken made it easier not to overshoot the target temperature by as much as I have in the past.

I used the stick blender to liquify the sauce.  It seemed frothier than I remember.  Perhaps I have used the food processor in the past, and perhaps I should again.

I think it tasted better after being in the fridge for a day.

### Suggestions for next time
- Try using the food processor to liquify the sauce instead of the stick blender and see if the sauce still ends up frothed.
