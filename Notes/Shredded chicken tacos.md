# Shredded chicken tacos

## Thursday, 22 July 2021

I (David) had Alex Sanchez and his roommate William over before they moved.  They both thought this recipe came out very well.

There’s no way to do large batches of this recipe without getting at least 2 large bowls, the mixer bowl, and the Dutch oven dirty.  

In light of the fact that the Dutch oven is over two burners, keeping the burners lower when simmering the chicken made it easier not to overshoot the target temperature by as much as I have in the past.

I used the stick blender to liquify the sauce.  It seemed frothier than I remember.  Perhaps I have used the food processor in the past, and perhaps I should again.

I think it tasted better after being in the fridge for a day.

### Suggestions for next time
- Try using the food processor to liquify the sauce instead of the stick blender and see if the sauce still ends up frothed.

I'm considering making this dish for a pot luck.  To speed things up I'm planning to use the InstantPot and skip browning the meat.  I checked a few different recipe sites online, and the suggestions were as short as 5 minutes, or as long as 8 or 9.  Their ingredients and methods were all otherwise similar to the ATK recipe described here.

I checked some chicken recipes by Urvashi Pitre and they similarly range from 5 to 9 minutes.  I think butter chicken is the most similar recipe, and that uses 8 minutes so that is what I will try.

A quadruple batch (8 lbs. of chicken) is too much for the 8-quart InstantPot.  It fits with no room to spare so the pot will not come up to pressure.  I had Josh split it into two liners, and it worked fine.  the pot came up to pressure without scorching both times.  

### Notes for next time
-  A triple batch (6 lbs. of chicken) is the maximum for the 8-quart instant pot.
