# Amish beef and noodles
## Thursday 3 October 2024
### Recipe changes
I'm skipping browning to save on dishes, since I'd have to use the large cast iron skillet for that step only.  I'll delete the step if it works, and remove the strikethrough if it doesn't.

I'm making the version that the video described as something that could be eaten with a fork, as opposed to both a fork and a spoon.  This just uses half the broth.  Josh is going to make mashed potatoes.  If we like this, i can delete the struck text.  But I want us to consider that question, so I haven't deleted it.

I've adjusted the salt and MSG to meet our usual expectations.  There's also bullion in this recipe so it still might be too much.

I've added in cayenne pepper as suggested in the video.  Checking my other recipes, cayenne seems relatively heat-stable and is often added in before cooking so I'm doing that here.  The alternative to consider is adding it just before serving, which is what the video mentions.  I'm also starting with a conservative amount.  Other recipes I have use 1/3 teaspoon per pound of chicken.  But they also include things like yogurt that might balance the spice.  The amount may need adjustment

I'm starting with a cook time of 20 minutes.  I'm aiming for a final texture just before the meat falls completely apart.
### Comments
The amount of cayenne isn't actually measured because after measuring out a portion of the 1/4 teaspoon required for a double batch, there was still some amount left in the jar.  I thought it would be a small amount, but upon tapping the jar into the bowl it was not.  The stew was not in any way too spicy, so I can definitely increase the amount in the future.

The noodles eventually absorbed almost all the liquid from the dry version of the recipe describe above, but this happened after the first bowls were served.

Served atop mashed potatoes, the stew tasted like it could use a bit more salt.  Eaten on its own it's plenty salt.  I don't know if Josh salted the mashed potatoes that he made.  I should be more careful about measuring the bullion in the future and that should make the stew fine to eat on its own.  

Josh said he thinks the meat could have gone a bit longer and I agree. 

### Recipe changes
- I updated the cook time to 25 minutes
- I doubled the amount of cayenne per batch

### Suggestions for next time
- Try browning the meat first
- Make sure the mashed potatoes are salted
- Be more careful about measuring the bullion
    - Consider cutting the added salt

I tried opening the pressure cooker immediately after the time ran out and it made a huge mess.  This recipe sputters quite a bit.  I'm not sure why, I'm going to blame the flour. 

**This recipe requires at least a 10 minute cooldown before opening the pressure cooker**
### Suggestions for next time
- Make sure that 10 minutes is enough cooldown time
- Do I want to try mushrooms in this?
