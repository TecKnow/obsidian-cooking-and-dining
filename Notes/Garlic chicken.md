# Garlic chicken - Notes
## Thursday, 28 October 2020
I (David) forgot to add the MSG, and I used the recommended amount of salt.  It was indeed very salty, so in the future, I should use my customary amount.  Otherwise, the flavor was very good.  We didn’t get any leftovers from a triple batch. The chicken had to be deboned manually so the amount was probably slightly less than three pounds but I don’t think we would have had leftovers regardless.

We should try this recipe with boneless chicken breasts in the future.  The extra surface area of the deboned chicken means almost all the marinade stuck to the chicken even when the recipe said to leave as much as possible behind.
### Suggestions for next time
- Only use ½ teaspoon of salt per pound of chicken. (Recipe updated)
- Add ½ teaspoon MSG per pound of chicken (Recipe updated)
- Use boneless chicken breasts
