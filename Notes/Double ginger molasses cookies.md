# Double ginger molasses cookies
## Monday, 21 September 2020
### Notes
This was a double batch, but I accidentally added 4 tablespoons of instant espresso powder instead of 4 teaspoons.  Henry thought this was great because “the coffee flavor punches out the ginger flavor and says ‘It’s coffee time now!’”  Josh rolled and baked these on a baking sheet instead of using the muffin tin method described in the recipe.  The cookies were quite flat.

Even though the coffee flavor was overwhelming, the cookies were still quite good and had a long flavor evolution.

Remember that chopping candied ginger is a pain.  If you chop it too small then the pieces stick together.
