# Lemon curd
## Thursday, 21 April 2022
I (David) ended up using 5 small lemons to get the correct amount of juice, and I included the zest of all five lemons.  The resulting curd was very tart, and not too sweet.  We all like that.  It is very astringent by itself, but the cake and whipped cream helped balance that out.

I had some on top of strawberry ice cream.  The strong lemon flavor overpowered the mild strawberry flavor of the ice cream, but the combination of textures was good.

*The Pastry Chef’s Guide* says that curds are just custards made with fruit juice instead of milk or cream.  On a certain level this is correct.  However, practical lessons learned from making custards do not cross-apply. 

The liquid is too thin to stir with the hand mixer, and seems to get thicker in a linear way rather than passing through distinct stages the way that custards (especially those with cornstarch) do.

### Suggestions for next time

- Do I want to try making a lime curd? 
- Do I want to try setting it with agar agar?
- Do I want to try thickening it with cornstarch?  
    - This is what Alton Brown does in Good Eats, the recipe that gave Josh so much trouble**
