#  Instant pot whole chicken
## Recommended by

### Recommender comments
>  If you do try the chicken recipe, most of the birds at the supermarket weigh more than they developed times for. Iâ€™ve found 5 minutes of cook time plus 18 minutes of natural release pretty much gets the American sized chickens cooked safely.
