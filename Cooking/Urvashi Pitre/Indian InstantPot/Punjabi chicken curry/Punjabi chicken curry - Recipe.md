# Punjabi chicken curry
## Ingredients
- 1 onion, peeled and quartered
- 1 tbsp minced ginger
- 2 tomatoes, quartered
- 0.5 cups Greek yogurt
- 2 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 tsp kosher salt
- 0.5 tsp ground cayenne pepper
- 2 tsp ground turmeric
- 2 tsp garam masala, divided
- 0.25 cups water
- 1.5 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs
- 10 oz. fresh spinach, chopped
## Directions
1. In a food processor or blender, place the onion, ginger-garlic paste, tomatoes, yogurt, cornstarch, salt, cayenne, turmeric, 1 teaspoon of garam masala, and water. Blend until smooth.
2. In the inner cooking pot of the Instant Pot®, arrange the chicken. Pour in the sauce.
3. Lock the lid into place. Select Soup and adjust the pressure to High. Cook for 8 minutes.
4. When the cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes and then quick-release any remaining pressure.
5. Unlock and remove the lid. Remove the chicken to a cutting board.
6. Select Sauté and adjust for medium heat. Add the spinach to the sauce. When the chicken is cool enough to handle, cut it into smaller pieces, and add it back in. With the lid off, allow the sauce to simmer and thicken and the spinach to cook down.
7. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of garam masala and stir.		
8. Serve with rice, cauliflower rice, naan, or with mashed potatoes for a unique combination.
