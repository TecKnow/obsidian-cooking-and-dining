Henry couldn’t find scotch bonnet chilis.  He got some other peppers that wikipedia said were related.  They may have been habanero peppers, although they were green rather than red.

The dish wasn’t very spicy at all.  It was good but somewhat bland.  Even though it already had potatoes, the rice went very well with it and absorbed some of the extra liquid which I (David) appreciate.

#### Suggestions for next time
- Use a hotter pepper
- Use even more of the curry powder
