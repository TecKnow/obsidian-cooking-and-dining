# Beef rendang
## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil
- 0.75 cup finely minced onions
- 1 tbsp minced fresh ginger
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 small jalapeno or serrano chili seeded if desired and minced
- 1 <span data-qty-no-parse>1.2 ounce</span> package rendang curry paste
- 1 pound skirt steak cut into 1 inch chunks
- 1/2 cup water
- 1 cup full fat coconut milk
- 2 tbsp unsweetened shredded coconut, toasted for garnish

## Directions
1. Select SAUTE on the Instant Pot.  When the pot is hot, add the oil.  When the oil is hot, add the onions, ginger, garlic, and jalapeno, stirring to coat with the oil.  Add the curry paste.  Cook, stirring, until the curry paste is lightly toasted, 3 to 4 minutes.
2. Add the steak and cook, stirring to coat with the spices, for about 2 minutes.  Pour in <span data-qty-parse>1/4 cup</span> of water and stir to scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pot.  (Not only do these browned bits add flavor to the finished dish, but if you leave any browned bits at the bottom, the pot will not come to pressure.)
3. Add the remaining <span data-qty-parse>1/4 cup</span> of water and <span data-qty-parse>1/2 cup</span> of the coconut milk.  Select CANCEL.	
4. Secure the lid on the pot.  Close the pressure-release valve.  Select MANUAL and set the pot at HIGH pressure for 25 minutes.  At the end of the cooking time, allow the pot to sit undisturbed for 10 minutes, then release any remaining pressure.
5. If you want the dish to be a little less saucy, select SAUTE to cook off some of the water.  (Note that the sauce will thicken as it cools.)  Add the remaining <span data-qty-parse>1/2 cup</span> of coconut milk and stir well to combine.  Select CANCEL.
6. Divide among four bowls and garnish with the shredded coconut before serving.
