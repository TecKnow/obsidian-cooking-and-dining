I made a double batch.  Things went according to the recipe except that the coconut milk was much thicker than the ones I (David) have used in the past.  Instead of adding some before cooking and some after I accidentally added all of it, plus more, before cooking.  Josh reduced the sauce on the stovetop for about 15 minutes and the stirring caused the meat to fall apart.  The texture of the meat was very good, so perhaps I should cut the meat up smaller so that it doesn't take 15 minutes of extra stirring to achieve this next time.
### Suggestions for next time
- See if adding more coconut milk after cooking makes a difference.
- Perhaps cut the meat strips in half.
- Perhaps add more jalapenos, since virtually all the spice disappeared.

We all seem to have forgotten that this is actually quite good.  Each batch doesnâ€™t produce too much food, though, so a double batch left us with no leftovers.  I forgot to mention that the meat needed to be cut into smaller pieces, and it still does.
