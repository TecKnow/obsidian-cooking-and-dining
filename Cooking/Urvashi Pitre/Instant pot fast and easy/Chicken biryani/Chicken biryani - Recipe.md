# Chicken biryani - Recipe
## Ingredients
- 51 grams (2 ounces) ghee
- 1 tablespoon cumin seeds
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 8 cloves
- 10 black peppercorns
- 10 cardamom pods
- 2 small onions, thinly sliced	
- 1 ounce ginger, minced		
- 8 cloves garlic, crushed
- 4 jalapeno chiles, diced	
- 2 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 16 sprigs fresh mint, chopped fine
- 2 basmati rice, rinsed and drained
- salt
- 2 cups water
## Instructions
1. Preheat the Instant Pot® by selecting Sauté and adjust to More for high heat. When the inner cooking pot is hot, add the ghee and heat until it is shimmering. Add the cumin seeds, cinnamon, cloves, peppercorns, and cardamom pods. Stir and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the spices are sizzling.
2. Once the spices sizzle, add the onion and cook until it’s well browned and crisp at the edges.
3. Add the ginger, garlic, and jalapeños and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Add the chicken pieces and sear gently on both sides to precook the chicken slightly.
5. Spread out the chicken-and-vegetable mixture to cover the bottom of the pot.
6. Sprinkle the chopped cilantro and mint over the chicken mixture.
7. Spread the rice across everything and sprinkle salt over the top. Do not stir.
8. Pour in the water and gently push the rice down so it is mostly covered by the water.
9. Lock the lid into place. Select Manual and adjust the pressure to High. Cook for 5 minutes. 
10. When the cooking is complete, let the pressure release naturally. Unlock the lid.
11. Open and inhale deeply! Enjoy the true-to-tradition aroma of this dish, and then either mix it gently from the bottom or serve it by scooping up a layer from top to bottom so you include the chicken, herbs, and rice in every serving.
