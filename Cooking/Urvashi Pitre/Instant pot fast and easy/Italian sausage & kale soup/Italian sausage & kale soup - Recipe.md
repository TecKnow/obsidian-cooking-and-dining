# Italian sausage & kale soup
>[!warning]
> A triple batch is too large for the 8-qt InstantPot.
## Ingredients
- 1 lb. bulk hot Italian sausage meat
- 1 cup diced yellow onions
- 6 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 cups diced potatoes
- 1 12-ounce package frozen kale
- 3 cups water
- 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 1/2 cups shredded parmesan cheese
## Directions
1. Select SAUTE on the Instant Pot.  When the pot is hot, add the sausage.  Cook, stirring to break up the clumps, until it is the texture of ground beef, 3 to 4 minutes.  Add the onions and garlic and stir well to combine.  Add the potatoes and kale and stir well to combine.  Stir in the water.  Select CANCEL.
2. Secure the lid on the pot.  Close the pressure release valve.  Select MANUAL and set the pot at HIGH pressure for 6 minutes.  At the end of the cooking time, allow the pot to sit undisturbed for 5 minutes, then release any remaining pressure.			
3. Add the cream and stir well to combine.  Divide among four bowls.  Top with the Parmesan and serve.

>If you're squeamish about fat in your soups, you may want to refrigerate the soup until the fat rises to the top, then skim it off before reheating and adding the cream.
