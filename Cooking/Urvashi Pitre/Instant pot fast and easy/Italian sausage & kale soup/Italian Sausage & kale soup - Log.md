# Italian Sausage & kale soup - Log
## Thursday 15 July 2021
A triple batch of this soup is slightly too large for the 8-quart instant pot.

The soup base is good and this recipe deserves further experimentation.  It’s very quick to put together.  It is entirely dependent on the Italian sausage meat for spice, though.  By itself, it needs more seasoning.

### Suggestions for next time
- Don’t make a triple batch
- Investigate what sort of spices go into Italian sausage and then add some of them to the soup.
