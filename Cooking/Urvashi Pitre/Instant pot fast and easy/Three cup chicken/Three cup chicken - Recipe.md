# Three cup chicken - Recipe
## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup toasted sesame oil
- 6 red chiles, dried
- 1/4 cup crushed garlic cloves
- 2 tbsp fresh ginger, julienned
- 2 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs, halved
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/4 cup rice wine or pale dry sherry
- salt
- 1/4 cup fresh Thai basil or sweet basil, chopped
- 1/2 tsp xanthan gum
## Directions
1. Select SAUTE on the Instant Pot.  When the pot is hot, add the sesame oil.  When the oil is hot, add the chiles, garlic, and ginger.  Cook, stirring frequently, until the ginger and garlic are just starting to crisp, about 2 minutes.  Select CANCEL.
2. Add the chicken, soy sauce, and rice wine to the pot and season with salt.  Stir to combine.
3. Secure the lid on the pot.  Close the pressure-release valve.  Select MANUAL and set the pot for HIGH pressure for 7 minutes.  At the end of the cooking time, allow the pot to stand undisturbed for 10 minutes, then release any remaining pressure.
