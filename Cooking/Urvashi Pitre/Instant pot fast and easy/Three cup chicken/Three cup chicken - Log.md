# Three cup chicken - Log
## Thursday, 13 May 2021
There’s very little liquid in this recipe.  Be careful it doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot.  It will need rice and vegetables.

I used all the dried chilies because they were old and broken down, so the result was probably spicier than intended.  It was edible but the chile flavor was dominant.  The basil did not come through at all.  I also forgot to account for the saltiness of the soy sauce

### Suggestions for next time
- Reduce the salt since the soy sauce is already very salty.
- Use fresher dried chilies.

There are no pictures.  I used scallions instead of basil.  In keeping with the suggestion from last time, I (David) didn’t add any extra salt.  It was still noticeably salty.  There were no issues with the chicken sticking to the bottom of the pot this time.

I used the small bowl of the food processor to chop the garlic, since I had it out for other reasons.  It struggled with the frozen cloves but it did eventually work.  Chopping the ginger this way worked immediately and very well.

I used dark soy sauce, the sauce was noticeably darker and sweeter.  Everyone liked it overall.  I may want to adjust the ratio of regular soy sauce to dark soy sauce.

### Suggestions for next time

- Try using a ratio of regular and dark soy sauce.

Making a double batch of this did not present any problems with sticking on the bottom of the Instant Pot.  I (David) tried a mixture of about 50% dark soy sauce and 50% regular soy sauce. I am not sure which I prefer but this was very good.

Canan visited, and it was so good he couldn't resist the temptation to eat the dried peppers.  This gave him stomach trouble later.  Carl took some home and he also enjoyed it.  His “lizard brain” really wanted to eat the peppers also, but as far as I know he resisted the temptation.
