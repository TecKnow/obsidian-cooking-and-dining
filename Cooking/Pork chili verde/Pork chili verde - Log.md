# Pork chili verde - Log
This is one of the few recipes that I remember fondly from my youth.  I talked to my mother years ago asking for the recipe and it was simply “do things until it’s done” so Josh did some research online.  The the basic recipe is here: [[Pork chili verde - recipe]]

I wanted to see about doing this with only a single pot, although the process dirtied basically all the large mise en place containers that we have.  I sauteed the jalapenos, onion, and garlic in the InstantPot liner.  Then I added the beer and orange juice to reduce them.  Then I simmered the tomatoes and tomatillos.  Then I added the meat and cooked at high pressure for 25 minutes.  About 10 minutes before serving I added the beans and simmered them.  I didn’t brown the meat.  Everything seemed to work out.

The only dark beer that the store had was a milk stout.  The resulting stew was very sweet.  It wasn’t bad to eat, but it was very strange.

I saw Josh picking the fat off the pieces of pork.

### Suggestions for next time
- Maybe I should trim the pork more for Josh's comfort
- Henry is willing to go to the liquor store to avoid getting a sweet beer next time.  My sister suggested Sprecher's Black Bavarian, although she is not sure it is still available.
