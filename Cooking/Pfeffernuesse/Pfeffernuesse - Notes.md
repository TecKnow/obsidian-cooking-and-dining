# Pfeffernuesse - Notes
- The cookies will improve as they age.
- The butter, honey, and molasses may not combine, and will almost certainly separate at least partially as they cool.  As long as they flow freely this is probably fine.
## Suggestions from past attempts
- zest of additional oranges
- 1/2 cup candied orange peel
    - Josh likes this.  The change in texture is not as noticeable as I (David) feared.
- age the dough in the fridge overnight
    - This doesn’t make a difference
- age the dough in the freezer overnight
    - This doesn’t make a difference
- 1 tsp instant coffee
    - Josh likes this.  I (David) am not sure if it makes a difference yet
- 1/2 cup sliced almonds
- 2 Tbsp rum or brandy

### Notes
I made a double batch and added an entire half-pound container of candied orange peel as well as the suggested amount of espresso powder from above.

I absolutely need to remember to warm the butter-molasses-honey mixture at the start.  It reaches about 130℉ but takes a very long time to cool, at least 45 minutes.

Josh would like me to record that he rolled the dough into logs in parchment, froze overnight, then divided up using a #60 fisher and formed into balls.  The cookies seemed a bit flatter to me than they have been in the past but Josh says that it is because I was looking at an early batch.  The texture seems good in the mouth.

Remember that it is the cloves that make the grinder container sticky. Grind the cloves last. 

I mistakenly thought it was the cardamom because I imagined they are sticky after they are cut from their pods. That's sickness does not transfer to the grinder as much as i had feared.

The spice mixture for a quadruple batch, after sitting and not including espresso powder weighed 107 g.
