# Pfeffernuesse
## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup dark molasses
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup  or 144 g granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup or 96 g dark brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 500 g AP flour
- 2 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp ground ginger
- 1 1/2 tsp grated nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 7 cardamom pods, seeds only, ground
- 1 1/2 tsp ground allspice
- 1 1/2 tsp ground cloves
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper
- 3 star anise pods, ground
- 2 tsp anise extract
- 1 orange, zest only
- 1/2 cup (120 g) candied orange peel
- 1 tsp espresso powder or instant coffee
- 1 cup powdered sugar for dusting
## Directions
1. In a large heavy bottom pot over low heat melt the butter. Add the molasses and honey. Stir until combined (it will take a while). Remove from the heat.
2. Combine the white and brown sugars into the bowl of a stand mixer.
3. In a bowl combine the flour and ground spices. Sift or whisk to combine.
4. In a separate bowl lightly beat the eggs.
5. Once the butter, molasses, and honey mixture has cooled to below 80 degrees Fahrenheit add it to the sugars and cream, stopping after the first few minutes to scrape down the sides of the bowl.
6. Slowly add the beaten egg mixture and the anise extract. Add the citrus.
7. In three separate additions add the flour and spice mixture.
8. Form the dough into a log and wrap in wax paper. Chill for 2+ hours or freeze for 1+ hour.
9. Cut the log into slices  or use a no. 60 disher to portion.  Roll portions into balls and return them to the freezer.
10. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit.
11. Remove 40 dough balls from the freezer and space evenly on two silicone baking mat lined half-sheet pans.
12. Bake for 8 minutes, rotate the pans (top to bottom and front to back). Bake for an additional 8 minutes. Remove to a wire rack and cool for 8 minutes on the pans.
13. While the cookies are still slightly warm, place into a sealed container with the powdered sugar shake gently to coat. Tap cookies to remove excess powdered sugar and return to the wire rack and allow to cool completely.
