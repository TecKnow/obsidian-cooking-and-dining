## Ingredients
1. 1 pound prunes
2. 1 pound dark raisins
3. ½ pound golden raisins
4. 1 pound currants
5. 1 and ½ pound dried cherries, or 1 pound dried cherries plus ½ pound glace cherries
6. ½ pound mixed candied citrus peel
7. 2 cups dark rum; more for brushing cake
8. 1 and ½ cups cherry brandy or Manischewitz Concord grape wine; more for grinding fruit
9. ½ pound blanched almonds
10. 1 cup white or light brown sugar for burning, or ½ cup dark molasses or cane syrup; more molasses for coloring batter
11. 4 sticks (1 pound) butter, more for buttering pans
12. 1 pound (about 2 and ½ cups) light or dark brown sugar
13. 10 eggs
14. Zest of 2 limes
15. 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
16. ½ teaspoon Angostura bitters
17. 4 cups (1 pound) all-purpose flour
18. 4 teaspoons baking powder
19. 2 teaspoons cinnamon
## Directions
1. At least 2 days before baking, combine prunes, raisins, currants, cherries, candied peel, rum and brandy in a glass jar or sturdy plastic container.  Cover tightly; shake or stir occasionally.
2. When ready to bake, put soaked fruit and almonds in a blender or food processor; work in batches that the machine can handle.  Grind to a rough paste, leaving some chunks of fruit intact.  Add a little brandy or wine if neeed to listen the mixture in the machine.
3. If burning sugar, place a deep, heavy bottomed pot over high heat.  Add 1 cup white sugar or light brown sugar, and melt, stirring with a wooden spoon.  Stir, letting sugar darken.  (It will smoke.)  When sugar is almost black, stir in ¼ cup boiling water.  (It will splatter.)  Turn off heat.
4. Heat oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit.  Butter three 9-inch or 4 8-inch cake pans; line bottoms with a double layer of parchment or wax paper.
5. In a mixer, crema butter and 1 pound of light or dark brown sugar until smooth and fluffy.  Mix in eggs one at a time, then lime zest, vanilla, and bitters.  Transfer mixture to a very large bowl.  In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder, and cinnamon.  Fold dry ingredients into butter mixture.  Stir in fruit paste and ¼ cup burnt sugar or molasses.  Batter should be a medium-dark brown; if too light, add a tablespoon or two of burnt sugar or molasses.
6. Divide among prepared pans; cakes will not rise much, so fill pans almost to top.  Bake 1 hour, and reduce heat to 225 degrees Fahrenheit; bake 2 to 3 hours longer, until a tester inserted in center comes out clean.  Remove to a rack.
7. While cakes are hot, brush tops with rum and let soak in.  Repeat while cakes cool; they will absorb about for tablespoons total.  When cakes are completely cool, they can be turned out and served.  To keep longer, wrap cakes tightly in wax or parchment paper, then in foil.  Store in a cool, dry place for up to 1 month.
