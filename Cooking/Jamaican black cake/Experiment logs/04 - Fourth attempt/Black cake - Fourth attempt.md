# Black cake - Fourth attempt
## Ingredients
- 1 pound prunes
- 1 pound dark raisins
- ½ pound golden raisins
- 1 pound currants
- ½ pound dried cherries
 - ¼ pound glace cherries
- ½ pound maraschino cherries
- ¼ pound brandied cherries
- ¼ pound candied orange peel
- ¼ pound mixed candied citrus peel
- 2 cups dark rum; more for brushing cake
- 1 and ½ cups Manischewitz concord grape wine more for grinding fruit
- ½ pound blanched almonds
- ¼  cup dark molasses; 
- 4 sticks (1 pound) butter
- 1 pound (about 2 and ½ cups) dark brown sugar
- 10 eggs
- Zest of 2 limes
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon Angostura bitters
- 4 cups (1 pound) all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
## Directions
1. At least 2 days before baking, combine prunes, raisins, currants, cherries, candied peel, rum and brandy in a glass jar or sturdy plastic container.  Cover tightly; shake or stir occasionally.
2. When ready to bake, put soaked fruit and almonds in a blender or food processor; work in batches that the machine can handle.  Grind to a rough paste, leaving some chunks of fruit intact.  Add a little brandy or wine if need to loosen the mixture in the machine.
3. Heat oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit.  Butter three 9-inch or 4 8-inch cake pans; line bottoms with a double layer of parchment or wax paper.
4. In a mixer, cream butter and 1 pound of light or dark brown sugar until smooth and fluffy.  Mix in eggs one at a time, then lime zest, vanilla, and bitters.  Transfer mixture to a very large bowl.  In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder, and cinnamon.  Fold dry ingredients into butter mixture.  Stir in fruit paste and ¼ cup burnt sugar or molasses.  Batter should be a medium-dark brown; if too light, add a tablespoon or two of burnt sugar or molasses.
5. Divide among prepared pans; cakes will not rise much, so fill pans almost to top.  Bake 1 hour, and reduce heat to 225 degrees Fahrenheit; bake 2 to 3 hours longer, until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove to a rack.
6. While cakes are hot, brush tops with rum and let soak in.  Repeat while cakes cool; they will absorb about four tablespoons total.  When cakes are completely cool, they can be turned out and served.  To keep longer, wrap cakes tightly in wax or parchment paper, then in foil.  Store in a cool, dry place for up to 1 month.
## Design
This is based on the recipe from the third attempt.
### Notes
- Try soaking the almonds in rum instead of water.
- Use a roasting pan full of water on the bottom rack of the oven to prevent the cakes from drying out.
- According to the Good Eats fruitcake recipe, set the oven to 325 ℉ and check the temperature after 1 hour.  The target temperature is 200  ℉.
- From past attempts I (David) know that this may cause the edges to dry out.  I may try setting the temperature to 300 ℉ and may consider pulling the cakes any time after they reach 195 ℉.

#### Notes
- Soaking the almonds in rum does work, but they need to be soaked for more than 8 hours.
- This version of the cakes was very, very popular at Midwest Furfest
- The orange peel definitely helps increase the fruit flavor
