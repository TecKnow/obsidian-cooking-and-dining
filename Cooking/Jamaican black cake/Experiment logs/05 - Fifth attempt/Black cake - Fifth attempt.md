# Black cake - Fifth attempt
## Ingredients
- 1 pound prunes
- 1 pound dark raisins
- ½ pound golden raisins
- 1 pound currants
- ½ pound dried cherries
 - ¼ pound glace cherries
- ¾ pound maraschino cherries
- ¼ pound candied orange peel
- ¼ pound mixed candied citrus peel
- 2 cups Cruzan Aged Dark Rum; more for brushing cake
- 1 and ½ cups Manischewitz concord grape wine more for grinding fruit
- ½ pound almonds soaked in rum and peeled
- ¼  cup Blue Mountain Country burnt sugar browning 
- 4 sticks (1 pound) butter
- 1 pound (about 2 and ½ cups) dark brown sugar
- 10 eggs
- Zest of 2 limes
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon Angostura bitters
- 4 cups (1 pound) all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons cassia cinnamon
## Directions
1. At least 2 days before baking, combine prunes, raisins, currants, cherries, candied peel, rum and brandy in a glass jar or sturdy plastic container.  Cover tightly; shake or stir occasionally.
2. When ready to bake, put soaked fruit and almonds in a blender or food processor; work in batches that the machine can handle.  Grind to a rough paste, leaving some chunks of fruit intact.  Add a little brandy or wine, if need to loosen the mixture in the machine.
3. Place a roasting pan half-full with hot water in the bottom, or lowest rack, of the oven.
4. Heat oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.  Grease and line four loaf pans with parchment paper.
5. In a mixer, cream butter and 1 pound of light or dark brown sugar until smooth and fluffy.  Mix in eggs one at a time, then lime zest, vanilla, and bitters.  Transfer mixture to a very large bowl.  In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder, and cinnamon.  Fold dry ingredients into butter mixture.  Stir in fruit paste and ¼ cup burnt sugar or molasses.  Batter should be a medium-dark brown; if too light, add a tablespoon or two of burnt sugar or molasses.
6. Divide among prepared pans; cakes will not rise much, so fill pans almost to top.  Target temperature 195-200 degrees Fahrenheit.  
7. While cakes are hot, spray tops with rum and let soak in.  Repeat while cakes cool.
8. Once the cakes have cooled, turn them out and wrap them in cheesecloth.  Spray them on all sides with rum and store them in airtight containers.
9. For the first month check the cakes every 2-3 days.  If they feel dry, spray them on all sides with rum again.  Return them to storage with the wet side up.
10. After the first month, you can check every week or so.
11. If you want to eat this as cake, I like them after about 2 weeks to a month.  They’ll still be pretty solid.
12. If you want to see how much alcohol you can get into the cake, they start to get wetter and stickier after about 3 months.  English tradition is to age them for an entire year, and make next year’s Christmas cake on boxing day (The day after Christmas).

### Notes
- The recipe has been updated to remove the brandied cherries, since I (David) don’t really like them.
- The recipe has been updated to include soaking the almonds in rum.  Note that this takes longer than blanching them in water, probably about two days.
- The recipe has been updated to reflect the way that I cooked the previous batch.  I may want to consider lowering the temperature even more.
