# Black cake - Second attempt
## Ingredients
- 1 cup pitted dates
- 1 cup dried figs
- 1 and ¼ cups Manischewitz Concord Grape Wine
- 1 and ¼ cups white rum, such as Appleton
- ½ cup sliced almonds
- ½ cup brandied cherries with their liquid
- ½ cup currants
- ½ cup candied orange peel
- ½ cup dried prunes
- ½ cup dark raisins
- ½ cup golden raisins
- 1 orange, juiced
- 1 and ½ cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter
- 2 cups flour, sifted
- 2 cups brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- Salt, one pinch
- 1 teaspoon molasses
- 1 teaspoon browning
- 5 eggs
## Directions
1. Add the dates, figs, 1 cup of the port, 1 cup of the rum, the almonds, brandied cherries with their liquid, currants, candied orange peel, prunes, and dark and golden raisins to a food processor. Process this mixture until the dried fruit is broken down into smaller chunks. Stir in the orange juice. Allow it to soak in the rum for at least 2 hours 30 minutes, but preferably for 2 to 3 days.
2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  Grease 2 cake pans and line them with brown or wax paper.
3. In a stand mixer, combine the butter, flour, brown sugar, baking powder, allspiace, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, salt, molasses, browning and eggs.  Slowly add the rum-soaked fruit to the mixer a little at a time and mix to combine all the ingredients.
4. Divide the cake batter between the prepared cake pans.  Bake the cakes in a water bath by filling a large roasting pan halfway up with water and then setting the cake pans inside.  Bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes.
5. Sprinkle the remaining port and rum on top of the cakes and let them cool.  These cakes will last for days stored in parchment paper and plastic wrap and for weeks when frozen.
## Design
The food network recipe is the most similar to how I usually make fruitcake, so I think I’ll try that second and triangulate from there.

#### Notes
It’s now 7 February 2021, I (David) apparently forgot to write these notes down before.  The main thing about this version is that it was cooked with the cake pans partially submerged and it came out with a very bread-pudding-like texture that people, including me, generally did not like.  The fruit flavor was a bit sharper though.  That may be a result of the candied orange peel.
