# Black cake - First attempt
## Ingredients

- 1 pound prunes
- 1 pound dark raisins
- ½ pound golden raisins
- 1 pound currants
- 1 pound dried cherries plus ½ pound glace cherries
- ½ pound mixed candied citrus peel
- 2 cups dark rum; more for brushing cake
- 1 and ½ cups cherry brandy more for grinding fruit
- ½ pound blanched almonds
- ¼  cup dark molasses; more molasses for coloring batter
- 4 sticks (1 pound) butter, more for buttering pans
- 1 pound (about 2 and ½ cups) light or dark brown sugar
- 10 eggs
- Zest of 2 limes
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon Angostura bitters
- 4 cups (1 pound) all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
### Instructions
1. At least 2 days before baking, combine prunes, raisins, currants, cherries, candied peel, rum and brandy in a glass jar or sturdy plastic container.  Cover tightly; shake or stir occasionally.
2. When ready to bake, put soaked fruit and almonds in a blender or food processor; work in batches that the machine can handle.  Grind to a rough paste, leaving some chunks of fruit intact.  Add a little brandy or wine if need to loosen the mixture in the machine.
3. Heat oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit.  Butter three 9-inch or 4 8-inch cake pans; line bottoms with a double layer of parchment or wax paper.
4. In a mixer, cream butter and 1 pound of light or dark brown sugar until smooth and fluffy.  Mix in eggs one at a time, then lime zest, vanilla, and bitters.  Transfer mixture to a very large bowl.  In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder, and cinnamon.  Fold dry ingredients into butter mixture.  Stir in fruit paste and ¼ cup burnt sugar or molasses.  Batter should be a medium-dark brown; if too light, add a tablespoon or two of burnt sugar or molasses.
5. Divide among prepared pans; cakes will not rise much, so fill pans almost to top.  Bake 1 hour, and reduce heat to 225 degrees Fahrenheit; bake 2 to 3 hours longer, until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove to a rack.
6. While cakes are hot, brush tops with rum and let soak in.  Repeat while cakes cool; they will absorb about four tablespoons total.  When cakes are completely cool, they can be turned out and served.  To keep longer, wrap cakes tightly in wax or parchment paper, then in foil.  Store in a cool, dry place for up to 1 month.
## Design
The NYT cooking recipe is the most different from the way that the fruitcakes are normally cooked, so I think I will start with that.  I’ve repeated the recipe below, making any selections that the recipe lists as optional
### Notes
- I used Appleton’s light rum by mistake.
- I began macerating the fruit on Monday 5 October.
- I plan to brown these with the browning, as opposed to the burnt sugar sauce or burning sugar myself.
- I plan to bake these with a roasting pan full of hot water in the oven to prevent them from drying out.  Oven to 325 degree Fahrenheit, target temperature 200 degrees Fahrenheit, guideline time 1 hour.
- I decided to blanch the almonds by soaking them in water overnight.  This is supposed to be the preferred method if the almonds are going to be made into a paste.  Since they are to be blended with the fruit, I assume that this is the intended method.  Removing the skins is supposed to make the almonds less bitter.  If the overnight soak in water works well, in the future I may try soaking them in rum.

#### Notes
Most of the almonds came out of their skins easily after soaking in water overnight.  The fraction that did not want to come out were a significant amount of work.  I found that the most effective thing to do was set the round bottom of the almond on the table and press down with my thumb so that it would split.  Using the edge of the tablecloth to rub the almonds also helped.  In the future it may be easier just to blanch slightly more almonds than I actually need and eat the ones that don’t peel.

I used the spur tree browning which has a difficult to describe, slightly citrusy flavor.  It definitely isn’t only food coloring.

The cakes took about two hours to come almost all the way up to the target temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  The corners of the cake were overdone, but the middle section was fine.  I may need to be comfortable pulling them anytime after 195 degrees Fahrenheit if the corners start to burn.  I should also try cooking them in round cake tins.

Since these cakes weren’t aged, the alcohol flavor was noticeable but not overpowering.  The texture of the small bits of fruit is very clear and different from the traditional European style fruitcakes.  

Henry says the flavor is primarily one of molasses for him.  It’s definitely fruity to me (David) but I don’t know if I could tell you it was cherries.  There aren’t many spices in this cake so I wouldn’t say it tasted like a holiday cake.
