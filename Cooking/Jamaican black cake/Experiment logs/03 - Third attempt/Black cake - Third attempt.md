# Black cake - Third attempt
## Ingredients
- 1 pound prunes
- 1 pound dark raisins
- ½ pound golden raisins
- 1 pound currants
- ½ pound dried cherries
- ¼ pound glace cherries
- ½ pound maraschino cherries
- ¼ pound brandied cherries
- ¼ pound candied orange peel
- ¼ pound mixed candied citrus peel
- 2 cups dark rum; more for brushing cake
- 1 and ½ cups Manischewitz concord grape wine more for grinding fruit
- ½ pound blanched almonds
- ¼  cup dark molasses; more molasses for coloring batter
- 4 sticks (1 pound) butter, more for buttering pans
- 1 pound (about 2 and ½ cups) light or dark brown sugar
- 10 eggs
- Zest of 2 limes
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- ½ teaspoon Angostura bitters
- 4 cups (1 pound) all-purpose flour
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
## Directions
1. At least 2 days before baking, combine prunes, raisins, currants, cherries, candied peel, rum and brandy in a glass jar or sturdy plastic container.  Cover tightly; shake or stir occasionally.
2. When ready to bake, put soaked fruit and almonds in a blender or food processor; work in batches that the machine can handle.  Grind to a rough paste, leaving some chunks of fruit intact.  Add a little brandy or wine if need to loosen the mixture in the machine.
3. Heat oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit.  Butter three 9-inch or 4 8-inch cake pans; line bottoms with a double layer of parchment or wax paper.
4. In a mixer, cream butter and 1 pound of light or dark brown sugar until smooth and fluffy.  Mix in eggs one at a time, then lime zest, vanilla, and bitters.  Transfer mixture to a very large bowl.  In a separate bowl combine flour, baking powder, and cinnamon.  Fold dry ingredients into butter mixture.  Stir in fruit paste and ¼ cup burnt sugar or molasses.  Batter should be a medium-dark brown; if too light, add a tablespoon or two of burnt sugar or molasses.
5. Divide among prepared pans; cakes will not rise much, so fill pans almost to top.  Bake 1 hour, and reduce heat to 225 degrees Fahrenheit; bake 2 to 3 hours longer, until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove to a rack.
6. While cakes are hot, brush tops with rum and let soak in.  Repeat while cakes cool; they will absorb about four tablespoons total.  When cakes are completely cool, they can be turned out and served.  To keep longer, wrap cakes tightly in wax or parchment paper, then in foil.  Store in a cool, dry place for up to 1 month
## Design
This is based on the recipe from the first attempt.
### Notes
- I plan to brown these with the browning, as opposed to the burnt sugar sauce or burning sugar myself.
- I plan to bake these with a roasting pan full of hot water in the oven to prevent them from drying out.  The Good Eats instructions are to set the oven to 325 degree Fahrenheit, target temperature 200 degrees Fahrenheit, guideline time 1 hour.  I may try following the recipe instructions above.
## Results
I (David) forgot to take pictures and notes when these were made.  I only got to try a small piece myself.  The texture was about what I expected from using the same method on the regular fruitcakes.  Dan Roer and Alex Culver both thought the flavors were well balanced.  Cory Drewry thought they were too stodgy and boozy.  Colleen Walsh thought the first few bites were very boozy but it faded later.  She thought the texture and fruit flavors were good.
